/**
 * Imports another build file into the current project.
 *
 * Targets and properties of the imported file can be overrridden 
 * by targets and properties of the same name declared in the importing file. 
 *
 * The imported file will have a new synthetic property of 
 * "phing.file.<projectname>" declared which gives the full path to the 
 * imported file. Additionally each target in the imported file will be 
 * declared twice: once with the normal name and once with "<projectname>." 
 * prepended. The "<projectname>.<targetname>" synthetic targets allow the 
 * importing file a mechanism to call the imported files targets as 
 * dependencies or via the <phing> or <phingcall> task mechanisms.
