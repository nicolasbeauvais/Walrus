README 
======
This catalog holds all customized XSL style sheets responsible for the XSLT transformations of
DocBook5 sources into either PDF or (X)HTML.

NOTE: In order to render the syntax highlight the xslthl-2.x.x.jar must be installed in the
CLASSPATH (e.g. "/usr/share/java/xslthl-2.0.2.jar" ) and the saxon 6.5.x xsl processor available. 
For the non-syntax highlight versions a plain version of xsltproc is sufficient.
 
All syntax highlight versions should be rendered with the "hlsaxon" script included in the
"../../scripts/" directory. Please note that the script has hard code paths to necessary
xslt DocBook5 standard stylesheets and may need to be adjusted to the system this is run on.

 
The stylesheets are organized as follows:

Generic
=======
common.xsl              Common settings generic to all output rendering

HTML Rendering
==============

html.xsl                Main script for html rendering without syntax highlighting
hl-html.xsl             Main script for html rendering with syntax highlighting
    html-highlight.xsl  Sub-style sheet to hl-html.xsl for setting coiors in highliting
chunk.xsl               Chunked version of html. No Syntax highlighting
html.fancycmd.xsl       Alternative html rendering with syntax highlighting and an
                        alterantive rendering of screen output looking like a terminal.
                        
PDF Rendering
=============
Note: PDF rendering always happen in two steps. First the docbook sources are transformed 
into a XSL-FO and then to pdf with the means of "fop"

fo-common.xsl           Common setting for all XSL-FO rendering
fo.xsl                  Plain XSL-FO rendering
hl-fo.xsl               XSL-FO rendering with syntax highlighting
    fo-highlight.xsl    Sub-style sheet to hl-fo.xsl for setting coiors in highlighting

Other renderings
================
epub.xsl                EPub rendering (experimental)
xmldepend.xsl           Create a list of all dependencies in an XML file
